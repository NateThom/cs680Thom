# Projects

## PA0 - Triangle
This is a simple colored triangle on the screen. To run this project ```cd PA0``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA1 - Spinning Cube
This is a cube that rotates in place on the screen. To run this project ```cd PA1``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA2 - Interaction: Menus, Keyboard, and Mouse
This is the same as PA1, but enables interation via the keyboard and a clickable menu. To run this project ```cd PA2``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA3 - Moons
Renders and additional cube which orbits the original.

## PA4 - Blender and Model Loading
Provides the functionallity to load custom models in the form of .obj files!. Also includes a new directory - "models" - which has the purpose of storing custom models. The user will find a simple model there to demonstrate the project's model loading feature.

## PA5 - Assimp and Model Loading
Use Assimp to load models and colors (and then display them).

## PA6 - Texture Loading
Use Assimp to load models and textures for those models.

## PA7 - Solar System
The objective of this project is to build an interactive solar system. 
Use Assimp to load models and textures for the planets/moons 
Use a data file for info on each object (size, orbit radius, rotation,...) 

## PA8 - Bullet
The purpose of this assignment is to become familiar with Bullet Physics, a 3D physics simulation engine.

## PA9 - Lighting
The purpose of this assignment is to create multiple shaders to do per vertex lighting and per fragment lighting. 

## PA10 - Pinball
The objective of this project is to build an interactive Pinball Game; use Assimp to load models and textures; use Bullett to handle the physics.
